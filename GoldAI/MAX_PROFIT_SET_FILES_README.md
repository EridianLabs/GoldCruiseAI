## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Before Using Maximum Profit Strategies:

1. **Test on Demo First**
   - Always test new risk levels on demo account
   - Run for at least 1-2 weeks
   - Monitor drawdowns and performance

2. **Understand the Risk**
   - Higher risk = higher potential profit BUT higher potential loss
   - Even with 92.94% win rate, losing streaks can happen
   - 5 losses in a row with 3% risk = 15% drawdown

3. **Account Size Matters**
   - **$1,000 account:** Use 2% or 3% risk (NOT Extreme)
   - **$2,000-$5,000:** Use 3% risk
   - **$5,000+:** Can consider Extreme (but still risky)

4. **Start Conservative**
   - Begin with 2% risk
   - If comfortable after 1-2 months, increase to 3%
   - Never jump straight to Extreme

## 💡 Why These Work

### High Win Rate (92.94%) Means:
- **You win 93 out of 100 trades**
- **You lose only 7 out of 100 trades**
- **Higher risk is justified** because you win most trades

### But Remember:
- **7 losses can still hurt** if risk is too high
- **Losing streaks happen** (even with high win rate)
- **Protect your account** with max drawdown limits
